# AVR Port selection

    In ATMEGA32A, we can give Analog input to any of eight channels of PORTA, it doesnâ€™t matter which channel we choose as 
    all are same. We are going to choose channel 0 or PIN0 of PORTA. In ATMEGA32A, the ADC is of 10 bit resolution, so the
    controller can detect a sense a minimum change of Vref/2^10, so if the reference voltage is 5V we get a digital output
    increment for every 5/2^10 = 5mV.So for every 5mV increment in the input we will have a increment of one at digital output.
