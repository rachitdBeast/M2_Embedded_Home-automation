# Requirements
## Introduction
    This mini project will help user to automate their home with a microcontroller and control devices like fans, light,curtains 
    and many more.

## Research
    With the increase in consumption of energy and population, there is a grave need to conserve energy in every way possible. 
    The inability to access and control the appliances from remote locations is one of the major reasons for energy loss. 
    A web or an android application is used by the users to give instructions to these systems.
    This system can make use of a host of communication methods such as Wi-Fi, GSM, Bluetooth, ZigBee.
    Different controlling devices and configurations can be found in existing systems.
    Such systems have been found already in many places for a wide variety of applications.
    
## Cost and Features and Timeline
    Its a very low cost system where only the core components cost minimal.
    
## Defining Our System
    A home automation system integrates electrical devices in a house with each other. The techniques employed in home automation
    include those in building automation as well as the control of domestic activities, such as home entertainment systems, houseplant 
    and yard watering, pet feeding, changing the ambiance "scenes" for different events (such as dinners or parties), and the use of 
    domestic robots. Devices may be connected through a computer network to allow control by a personal computer, and may allow remote 
    access from the internet.Typically, a new home is outfitted for home automation during construction, due to the accessibility of the
    walls, outlets, and storage rooms, and the ability to make design changes specifically to accommodate certain technologies. 
    Wireless systems are commonly installed when outfitting a pre-existing house, as they reduce wiring changes. These communicate
    through the existing power wiring, radio, or infrared signals with a central controller. Network sockets may be installed in every 
    room like AC power receptacles.Although automated homes of the future have been staple exhibits for World's Fairs and popular backgrounds
    in science fiction, complexity, competition between vendors, multiple incompatible standards [1] and the resulting expense have limited 
    the penetration of home automation to homes of the wealthy or ambitious hobbyists. Possibly the first "home computer" was an experimental 
    system in 1966.

    
## SWOT ANALYSIS
    Strength
    1. Very simple code and open source.
    2. Features can be added based on requirements.
    3. good processing speed to handle extra parameters
    Weakness
    1. Its very basic implementaion which doesnt allow for smart systems.
    2. Powercuts or any glitch will cause loss of control.
    Opportunity
    1. better coding skills will refine and shorten the code.
    2. Much more room to actually add more features with better security and compatibility.
    Threat
    1. As this is Open its susceptible to Hacks and Breach.
    2. malfuntion of this system can have adverse effect to user.
    
## 4W's and 1H
    Who: For all Personal's who want to ease their life.
    What: Great device to implement and open source platform.
    When: Whenever they want.
    Where: Either at office, home or public places.
    How: Simple menu based interface which is easy to understand and write.
